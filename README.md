# SVI
Implementation of the algorithm outlined here: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/johnson14.pdf. Specifically using stochastic variational inference to fit a hidden markov model to minute level stock data.

I am currently trying the code found here: https://github.com/dillonalaird/pysvihmm 

Dependencies: cython, pybasicbayes, numpy, pandas
